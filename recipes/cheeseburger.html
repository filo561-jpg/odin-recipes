        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.5 lbs of ground beef (80/20 mix is perfect)</li>
            <li>1 heaping tablespoon of sweet relish</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of yellow mustard</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of kitchen bouquet browning sauce or soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 small white onion grated on a cheese grater or minced VERY finely</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of celery salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1 /2 tablespoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon of onion powder</li>
            <li>Cheese of your choice</li>
            <li>Buns of your choice</li>
            <li>lettuce, tomato, sliced onion and pickle</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps and Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add your ground beef to a bowl, loosely break up the meat to make sure it is not in one big lump. This way you can season the meat evenly without having to mix it too much. Over mixed meat is what makes the burgers a strange texture.</li>
            <li>When you have your meat sort of spread out in the bowl loosely, sprinkle all the seasonings across the meat as if you were seasoning a steak. Then add the relish, mustard, kitchen bouquet and the grated onion.</li>
            <li>Mix the meat so that it is well combined, but do not over mix. Form four patties, make a dimple on the top of each. In the fridge for two hours, loosely covered. Each patty should be about 1/2 inch thick.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to cook, take the burgers out of the fridge 30 minutes before cooking and let sit out on the counter.</li>
            <li>Before cooking, make a little indentation (dimple) in the center of each burger with the back of a tablespoon. This helps the patty stay flat.</li>
            <li>When it is time to cook, get you skillet very hot with oil, but make sure the oil is not smoking. You can use a vegetable oil, or avocado oil.</li>
            <li>Add the burgers one at a time and cook for 6 minutes on each side. If yours are thinner they will need less time, if they are thicker than they will need more time. Make sure you are not pressing down on the burgers while they cook with your spatula. Just "set them and forget them" until it is time to flip them.</li>
            <li>You will know when it is time to flip them when they lift easily from the pan.</li>
            <li>At the end, add a slice of cheese to each one, and a couple tablespoons of water to the skillet, then cover so the cheese melts.</li>
            <li>Add your favorite burger toppings and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
