    <h2>Pork Adobo Over white rice</h2>
    <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino Cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And i've got to say, its definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo. check out Panlasangpinoy.com for more awesome authentic Filipino Dish as this one!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pork Belly</strong> - For a juicy, meaty dish!</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> - Makes for the most savory stew.</li>
        <li><strong>Dried bay leaves</strong> - Gives off the perfect adobo aroma</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar</strong> - Part of what makes adobo so brilliantly unique is its sourness, which we get from vinegar.</li>
        <li><strong>Soy sauce</strong> - There's nothing quite like the salty quality of soy sauce!</li>
        <li><strong>Peppercorn</strong> - Just for the slightest bit of spice!</li>
        <li><strong>Water</strong> - As this has a stew, we will definitely be using plenty of water!</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong> - And to make sure everything is nice and flavorful, you will be using some salt too. </li>
    </ul>    
        <p>Be prepared to do some marinating, but if you are in a rush, you have to do it for just 1 hour. After that, you can start working on your stew! We just need to combine our ingredients, and let them simmer for some time. Making adobo really is not as difficult as it may seem!</p>
