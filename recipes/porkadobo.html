    <h2>Pork Adobo Over white rice</h2>
    <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino Cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world. For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. And i've got to say, its definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually, there are other renditions of adobo.</p>
