            <h2>A True Italian Recipe</h2>
            <p>This authentic Italian spaghetti recipe, also know as ‘Nicco’s Sghetti’ in our family, is all the classic comfort of spaghetti with a true taste of Italy. A special thanks to Nick (my brother-in-law) for sharing this recipe with us! He spent two years in Italy and brought home all sorts of delicious, Italian recipes including this one. This traditional spaghetti quickly became a family favorite, and it’s one we make over and over because it truly is a little taste of Italy.</p>
            <p>Serve this up with Italian pasta noodles or make our homemade pasta from scratch (a recipe we learned at a culinary school in Napoli)! Try it alongside our Caprese Salad and Rosemary Garlic Focaccia Bread for a full meal. check out <a href="https://favfamilyrecipes.com">favfamilyrecipes.com</a> for more authentic family recipes like this one !</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tomatoes</strong> -  If you can’t peel and dice your own fresh garden tomatoes, whole canned D.O.P. San Marzano tomatoes (from the grocery store, look for the DOP label) are the best substitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Vegetables</strong> - Carrots, onions, and garlic are sautéed as a base for the meat sauce. These add a great flavor and a touch of sweetness.</li>
                <li><strong>Meat</strong> - You can use all beef, all pork, or a combination of both!</li>
                <li><strong>Seasoning</strong> - Authentic Italian spaghetti doesn’t require a lot of extra seasoning, all you need is some garlic, fresh basil, and salt and pepper.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar</strong> -  I only use sugar if I feel like the tomatoes I’m using aren’t sweet enough or if I feel like the acidity isn’t balanced. Taste your sauce along throughout the process and decide if you feel like it is needed or not.</li>
                <li><strong>Spaghetti Noodles</strong> - For best flavor and texture, use spaghetti or pasta imported from Italy, or make your own pasta. Authentic Italian spaghetti noodles are usually a pale cream color rather than bright yellow, with a slightly rough/textured, matte surface that helps sauce cling. They’re made from high-quality durum wheat semolina and are typically slow-dried, giving them a firm, yet chewy texture once cooked. It is very different from the smooth, yellow, shiny look of cheaper American-made pasta.</li>
            <h2>Tips for Making the Sauce</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Let the sauce simmer</strong> - The best spaghetti sauces take time. The longer you can let those flavors reduce and simmer together, the better. In many Italian kitchens, the sauce will simmer all day long before being served. It will get nice and thick without having to add tomato paste! If it gets too thick, just add a splash of beef broth to thin again.</li>
                <li><strong>Add a little red wine (optional)</strong> - add a splash of red wine to the meat after browning but before adding the other ingredients for a new dimension of flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Balance the sauce:</strong> - Taste your sauce and adjust the seasoning as needed. You might need a pinch of sugar to balance acidity or some salt and black pepper for flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t over sauce:</strong> - The sauce should coat the pasta, not drown it. Start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish in the pan:</strong> - Finish the pasta in the pan with the sauce for a few seconds. This allows the flavors to meld. Use a little reserved pasta water if needed to thin.</li>
                
            </ul>
