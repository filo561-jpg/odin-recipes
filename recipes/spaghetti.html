            <h2>A True Italian Recipe</h2>
            <p>This authentic Italian spaghetti recipe, also know as ‘Nicco’s Sghetti’ in our family, is all the classic comfort of spaghetti with a true taste of Italy. A special thanks to Nick (my brother-in-law) for sharing this recipe with us! He spent two years in Italy and brought home all sorts of delicious, Italian recipes including this one. This traditional spaghetti quickly became a family favorite, and it’s one we make over and over because it truly is a little taste of Italy.</p>
            <p>Serve this up with Italian pasta noodles or make our homemade pasta from scratch (a recipe we learned at a culinary school in Napoli)! Try it alongside our Caprese Salad and Rosemary Garlic Focaccia Bread for a full meal. check out <a href="https://favfamilyrecipes.com">favfamilyrecipes.com</a> for more authentic family recipes like this one!</p>
